Visualizing a vector space for a large language model (LLM) involves representing high-dimensional data (like word embeddings or token representations) in a way that’s easier to understand, typically by reducing dimensions to 2D or 3D for plotting. Here is a Python script that uses an LLM model served by Ollama to generate embeddings for a set of words or sentences, reduces their dimensionality using techniques like PCA or t-SNE, and visualizes the results in a 2D or 3D plot. 

1. How to Use:
Set up Ollama:
Ensure Ollama is running locally (http://localhost:11434).
Pull an embedding-capable model, e.g., ollama pull all-minilm or ollama pull llama3.
Update the model parameter in get_ollama_embeddings if needed.

2. Install Python dependencies:

```bash
pip install requests numpy scikit-learn matplotlib
```

3. Run the script:
   1. Save as visualize_vectorspace.py and run with python visualize_vectorspace.py.
   2. Enter words or sentences (e.g., “a cat fly over the bird”, “a bird eat a cat”).
   3. Type exit to stop and save plots.
   4. The 2D plot updates after 2+ valid inputs; the 3D plot updates after 3+ valid inputs.
   5. Final plots are saved as vectorspace_2d.png (and vectorspace_3d.png if 3+ embeddings).
